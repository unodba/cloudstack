Using Cisco ASA 1000v Firewall, Cisco Nexus 1000v dvSwitch, and Cisco VNMC in a Deployment


Guidelines
'''''''''''

-  Cisco ASA 1000v firewall is supported only in Isolated Guest
   Networks.

-  Cisco ASA 1000v firewall is not supported on VPC.

-  Cisco ASA 1000v firewall is not supported for load balancing.

-  When a guest network is created with Cisco VNMC firewall provider, an
   additional public IP is acquired along with the Source NAT IP. The
   Source NAT IP is used for the rules, whereas the additional IP is
   used to for the ASA outside interface. Ensure that this additional
   public IP is not released. You can identify this IP as soon as the
   network is in implemented state and before acquiring any further
   public IPs. The additional IP is the one that is not marked as Source
   NAT. You can find the IP used for the ASA outside interface by
   looking at the Cisco VNMC used in your guest network.

-  Use the public IP address range from a single subnet. You cannot add
   IP addresses from different subnets.

-  Only one ASA instance per VLAN is allowed because multiple VLANS
   cannot be trunked to ASA ports. Therefore, you can use only one ASA
   instance in a guest network.

-  Only one Cisco VNMC per zone is allowed.

-  Supported only in Inline mode deployment with load balancer.

-  The ASA firewall rule is applicable to all the public IPs in the
   guest network. Unlike the firewall rules created on virtual router, a
   rule created on the ASA device is not tied to a specific public IP.

-  Use a version of Cisco Nexus 1000v dvSwitch that support the vservice
   command. For example: nexus-1000v.4.2.1.SV1.5.2b.bin

   Cisco VNMC requires the vservice command to be available on the Nexus
   switch to create a guest network in CloudStack.


   指南
   Cisco ASA 1000v防火墙仅支持隔离的来宾网络。
   Cisco ASA 1000v不支持VPC。
   Cisco ASA 1000v不支持负载均衡。
   当使用Cisco VNMC防火墙创建的来宾网络时，一个额外的公共IP和SNAT IP一起被获取。SNAT IP用于规则，而额外的IP用于ASA外部接口。确保这一额外的公共IP不会被释放。你可以在网络一旦处在执行状态和获取其他公共IP之前确定这个IP。这个额外的IP没有被标识为SNAT。在你的来宾网络中可以通过Cisco VNMC来查找ASA外部接口的IP地址。
   使用单一网络中的公共IP地址段。不能添加不同网段的IP地址。
   每个VLAN中只允许一个ASA实例。因为ASA端口不支持多VLAN的trunk模式。因此，一个来宾网络中只能有一个ASA实例。
   每个区域中，只允许一个Cisco VNMC.
   只支持在Inline模式下部署负载均衡器。
   ASA防火墙策略适用于来宾网络中所有的公共IP地址。不同于虚拟路由器创建的防火墙规则，ASA设备创建的规则不绑定特定的公共IP地址。
   使用一个支持vservice命令的Cisco Nexus 1000v分布式虚拟交换机版本。例如：nexus-1000v.4.2.1.SV1.5.2b.bin

   使用Cisco VNMC在CloudStack中创建来宾网络，要求vservice命令在Nexus交换机中是可用的。

#. Click OK.


Adding an ASA 1000v Instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI as administrator.

#. In the left navigation bar, click Infrastructure.

#. In Zones, click View More.

#. Choose the zone you want to work with.

#. Click the Physical Network tab.

#. In the Network Service Providers node of the diagram, click
   Configure.

   You might have to scroll down to see this.

#. Click Cisco VNMC.

      IP address is used to connect to ASA 1000V.

   -  **Inside Port Profile**: The Inside Port Profile configured on
      Cisco Nexus1000v dvSwitch.

   -  **Cluster**: The VMware cluster to which you are adding the ASA
      1000v instance.

      Ensure that the cluster is Cisco Nexus 1000v dvSwitch enabled.

#. Click OK.


Creating a Network Offering Using Cisco ASA 1000v
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To have Cisco ASA 1000v support for a guest network, create a network
offering as follows:

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI as a user or admin.

#. From the Select Offering drop-down, choose Network Offering.

#. Click Add Network Offering.

#. In the dialog, make the following choices:

   -  **Name**: Any desired name for the network offering.

   -  **Description**: A short description of the offering that can be
      displayed to users.

   -  **Network Rate**: Allowed data transfer rate in MB per second.

   -  **Traffic Type**: The type of network traffic that will be carried
      on the network.

   -  **Guest Type**: Choose whether the guest network is isolated or
      shared.

   -  **Persistent**: Indicate whether the guest network is persistent
      or not. The network that you can provision without having to
      deploy a VM on it is termed persistent network.

   -  **VPC**: This option indicate whether the guest network is Virtual
      Private Cloud-enabled. A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private,
      isolated part of CloudStack. A VPC can have its own virtual
      network topology that resembles a traditional physical network.
      For more information on VPCs, see `“About Virtual Private Clouds”
      <http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-administration/en/latest/networking2.html#about-virtual-private-clouds>`_.

   -  **Specify VLAN**: (Isolated guest networks only) Indicate whether
      a VLAN should be specified when this offering is used.

   -  **Supported Services**: Use Cisco VNMC as the service provider for
      Firewall, Source NAT, Port Forwarding, and Static NAT to create an
      Isolated guest network offering.

   -  **System Offering**: Choose the system service offering that you
      want virtual routers to use in this network.

   -  **Conserve mode**: Indicate whether to use conserve mode. In this
      mode, network resources are allocated only when the first virtual
      machine starts in the network.

#. Click OK

   The network offering is created.


Reusing ASA 1000v Appliance in new Guest Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can reuse an ASA 1000v appliance in a new guest network after the
necessary cleanup. Typically, ASA 1000v is cleaned up when the logical
edge firewall is cleaned up in VNMC. If this cleanup does not happen,
you need to reset the appliance to its factory settings for use in new
guest networks. As part of this, enable SSH on the appliance and store
the SSH credentials by registering on VNMC.

#. Open a command line on the ASA appliance:

   #. Run the following:

      .. sourcecode:: bash

         ASA1000V(config)# reload

      You are prompted with the following message:

      .. sourcecode:: bash

         System config has been modified. Save? [Y]es/[N]o:"

   #. Enter N.

      You will get the following confirmation message:

      .. sourcecode:: bash

         "Proceed with reload? [confirm]"

   #. Restart the appliance.

#. Register the ASA 1000v appliance with the VNMC:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ASA1000V(config)# vnmc policy-agent
      ASA1000V(config-vnmc-policy-agent)# registration host vnmc_ip_address
      ASA1000V(config-vnmc-policy-agent)# shared-secret key where key is the shared secret for authentication of the ASA 1000V connection to the Cisco VNMC
